Release v0.1 (2020-08-24)
--------------------------
- ZED GStreamer package for Linux and Windows
- zedsrc: acquires camera color image and depth map and pushes them in a GStreamer pipeline.
- zedmeta: GStreamer library to define and handle the ZED metadata (Positional Tracking data, Sensors data, Detected Object data, Detected Skeletons data).
- zeddemux: receives a composite zedsrc stream (color left + color right data or color left + depth map + metadata), processes the eventual depth data and pushes them in two separated new streams named src_left and src_aux. A third source pad is created for metadata to be externally processed.
- zeddatamux: receive a video stream compatible with ZED caps and a ZED Data Stream generated by the zeddemux and adds metadata to the video stream. This is useful if metadata are removed by a filter that does not automatically propagate metadata
- zeddatacsvsink: example sink plugin that receives ZED metadata, extracts the Positional Tracking and the Sensors Data and save them in a CSV file.
- zedodoverlay: example transform filter plugin that receives ZED combined stream with metadata, extracts Object Detection information and draws the overlays on the oncoming filter
- RTSP Server: application for Linux that instantiates an RTSP server from a text launch pipeline "gst-launch" like.
